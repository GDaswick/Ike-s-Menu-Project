# Ikes-Menu-Project
Quick python script for getting all of the menu items and their ingredients from the Ike's website (a sandwich shop with a LOT of options with no descernible order to the offerings (https://www.ikessandwich.com/menu/) using Selenium. Shows the user all unique sandwich ingredients, allows them to input ingredients they want in their sandwich, and presents all of the sandwiches offered by Ike's with those ingredients. Simple GUI as well (this is my first ever attempt at making a GUI) using PySimpleGUI.
