# Ikes-Menu-Project

***May need to download an updated version of the Chromedriver (link at top of Python code file) for full functionality - I could've made the program store the most recent data it scraped, but it doesn't take too long so I just have it open the website very time it runs for the fun visual effectt***

Quick python script for getting all of the menu items and their ingredients from the Ike's website (a sandwich shop with a LOT of options with no descernible order to the offerings (https://www.ikessandwich.com/menu/) using Selenium. Shows the user all unique sandwich ingredients, allows them to input ingredients they want in their sandwich, and presents all of the sandwiches offered by Ike's with those ingredients. Simple GUI as well (this is my first ever attempt at making a GUI) using PySimpleGUI.
